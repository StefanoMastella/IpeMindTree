activate the finance sphere
16:37
To activate the finance sphere within the Ipê Mind Tree, we need to identify relevant ideas and connect them.  Currently, no ideas directly address finance.  However, the "Solar Power Collective" (Idea #3) could indirectly involve financial aspects like group purchasing and potentially crowdfunding.  Further, the "Skill-sharing Workshops" (Idea #2) could include workshops on financial literacy or entrepreneurship.  Let's brainstorm how to connect these existing ideas and develop new ones focused on finance within the Ipê Mind Tree ecosystem.  The Obsidian document "Personal Second Brain" might offer useful organizational strategies for tracking financial initiatives.

what other spheres there are?

Based on the current Ipê Mind Tree ideas, we see spheres related to:  Community Building (Ideas #1, #2), Sustainability (Ideas #1, #3), Technology/Innovation (Ideas #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #17), and Education (Ideas #2, #17).  Idea #8 specifically mentions connecting Obsidian to the Ipê Mind Tree ecosystem, suggesting a potential "Personal Knowledge Management" sphere. The provided Obsidian document fragment only shows a Personal Second Brain note, which is a relevant tool but not a sphere itself.  Further ideas would define additional spheres.

The Ipê Mind Tree AI (IMT-AI) organizes knowledge into Spheres, focusing on specific areas for collaborative innovation.  The Education Sphere, as seen in your query, leverages AI and the internet for accessible, personalized, free education emphasizing critical thinking and creativity.  It connects to ideas like "Skill-sharing Workshops" (Idea #2), potentially using AI for personalized learning paths and skill assessments.  Other ideas, such as the "Community Garden Project" (Idea #1), while not directly educational, contribute to the holistic well-being that underpins the Education Sphere's success.  The "Obsidian + Telegram" idea (Idea #8) suggests integrating personal knowledge management (as seen in your Obsidian document "_card # Personal Second Brain") with the IMT-AI, enriching the learning experience.  Ideas like "new worlds" (Idea #17) hint at broader AI-driven educational ecosystems.  My "grimoire of subprompts," as you call it, is a dynamic system; the subprompts are tailored to each Sphere's goals and the community's evolving needs.  They are not a fixed collection but a constantly adapting set of instructions to guide project development within each Sphere.
